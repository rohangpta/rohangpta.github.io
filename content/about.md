Hi! I'm Rohan Gupta and I'm currently a student at the University of
Pennsylvania studying [Networked and Social Systems
Engineering](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/), which is pretty much Computer Science
with some slightly esoteric but nonetheless interesting add-on courses like *Algorithmic Game Theory* and
*Scalable & Cloud Computing*. 

I'm broadly interested in systems programming, backend work, ML and related
infra, and programming languages. Some of the things I've worked on are below: 

- [Penn Clubs](https://pennclubs.com): Penn Clubs is the official student club
  repository at Penn. I work as a developer lead on the product, which is managed as part of the umbrella student development club [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org). Check us out! We build a lot of cool software for the Penn community.
- [Spruce](https://github.com/jaredasch/Spruce): A friend and I wrote a parser
  and interpreter (in Haskell!) for a custom language (called *Spruce*) with functional
  features (first class functions, lexically scoped closures) and low-level
  concurrency primitives (fork, wait) alongside a simple interface to support
  [transactions over memory](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm)
- [Distributed ML Pipeline](https://github.com/rohangpta/dist-ml-pipeline): For
  a DevOps final project, I built a distributed Machine Learning pipeline on
  Kubernetes that aims to be model-agnostic and supports MLOps practices (Continuous Training and Continuous Monitoring).
- [Minimax Group Fairness](https://github.com/rohangpta/523-final-project): For an Ethical Algorithm Design class (taught by [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/)), my group members and I implemented and extended a procedure in [Kearns' paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03108) on improving group fairness in ML, by "minimaxing" over group errors using the Polynomial Weights algorithm. I ran the implementation and experimentation portion of the project.
- [RuneScape 2D](https://github.com/rohangpta/runescape-2d): I used to play a lot of RuneScape when I was in high-school, so for a class final project I built a minimal 2D version of the game's old tutorial, mostly for nostalgia.

I've worked at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) on caching for their ML infra layer
as well as [Neuroflow](https://www.neuroflow.com/) on their suite of data
science products. I enjoyed the infrastructure and performance related work I
was exposed to and will be hopefully doing more of that at [Five
Rings](https://fiverings.com/) and [Citadel
Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/) in 2023.

In Fall 2022, I also co-taught a class on DevOps at Penn: [CIS 1880: DevOps](https://cis1880.org/). 

I love getting "in the weeds" with niche computer things, so I started an evolving [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLazCpc92HNpzdZsK-4_AKbn5GoAfjbycq) of the podcasts/talks I've listened to and enjoyed.
