Hi! I'm Rohan Gupta and I'm currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying [Networked and Social Systems Engineering](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/), which is pretty much Computer Science with some interesting add-on courses like *Algorithmic Game Theory* and *Scalable & Cloud Computing*. In my free time, I like to listen to EDM, play the piano (mediocrely), and go on walks.


I'm interested in Backend Development, Infrastructure, Machine Learning, and more recently Programming Languages. Some of the things I've worked on are below: 

- [Penn Clubs](https://pennclubs.com): Penn Clubs is the official student club repository at Penn. I work as a backend developer on the product, which is managed as part of the umbrella student development club [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org). Check us out! We build a lot of cool software for the Penn community.
- [Distributed ML Pipeline](https://github.com/rohangpta/dist-ml-pipeline): For a DevOps final project, I built a distributed Machine Learning pipeline on Kubernetes that is effectively model-agnostic and supports MLOps practices (Continuous Training and Continuous Monitoring).
- [Minimax Group Fairness](https://github.com/rohangpta/523-final-project): For an Ethical Algorithm Design class (taught by [Michael Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/)), my group members and I implemented and extended a procedure in [Kearns' paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03108) on improving group fairness in ML, by "minimaxing" over group errors using the Polynomial Weights algorithm. I ran the implementation and experimentation portion of the project.
- [RuneScape 2D](https://github.com/rohangpta/runescape-2d): I used to play a lot of RuneScape when I was in high-school, so for a class final project I built a minimal 2D version of the game's old tutorial, mostly for nostalgia.


Starting Fall 2022, I'll also be co-teaching a class on DevOps at Penn: [CIS 188: DevOps](https://cis188.org/). 

I love getting "in the weeds" with random dev things, so I started an evolving [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLazCpc92HNpzdZsK-4_AKbn5GoAfjbycq) of the podcasts/talks I've listened to and enjoyed.
