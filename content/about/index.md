Hi! I'm Rohan Gupta and I'm a student at the University of
Pennsylvania studying [Networked and Social Systems
Engineering](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/), which is a slightly modified version of Computer
Science at Penn. Here's to hoping its future is [bright](https://xkcd.com/1413/).

I'm mostly a software and technology person. I like reading about tech online, jumping down
[debugging rabbitholes](http://pennlabs.org/blog/false-promises/), House music,
any form of caffeine, and the occasional walk or two.

I've worked on
- caching for ML infra at [Stripe](https://stripe.com).
- low-level performance optimisation at [Five Rings](https://fiverings.com/).
- shared technology/infrastructure at [Citadel
Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/) (currently).

I'm a fan of indexing interesting pieces of information online:
[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:grohan/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLazCpc92HNpzdZsK-4_AKbn5GoAfjbycq).
