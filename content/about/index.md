Hi! I'm Rohan Gupta and I'm a recent graduate from the University of
Pennsylvania, where I studied in the [NETS
program](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/) (a derivative of Computer Science).

I'm currently working as a software engineer at Citadel
Securities in New York. My role focuses on automation of
various parts of the software development process. I previously worked at Five
Rings and Stripe.

I like reading about a lot of things online, with a recent focus on
- Technology infrastructure and developer tools.
- LLMs as interfaces for human creativity {code, reasoning, design}.
- Startups, VC, markets and related economics.

More generally, I enjoy systems thinking, house and techno, New York's vibrant
cultural scene, walks, and caffeine.

I'm a fan of indexing interesting and entertaining pieces of information online:
