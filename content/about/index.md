Hi! I'm Rohan Gupta and I'm currently a student at the University of
Pennsylvania studying [Networked and Social Systems
Engineering](https://www.nets.upenn.edu/), which is an irrelevant and
irreverent version of Computer
Science here at Penn. Here's to hoping its future is [bright](https://xkcd.com/1413/).

I'm mostly a software and technology person. I like reading about tech on Twitter, jumping down
[debugging rabbitholes](http://pennlabs.org/blog/false-promises/), House music,
and the occasional walk or two.

I worked at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) on caching for their ML infra layer
as well as [Neuroflow](https://www.neuroflow.com/) on their suite of data
science products. I enjoyed the infrastructure and performance related work I
was exposed to and will be hopefully doing more of that at [Five
Rings](https://fiverings.com/) and [Citadel
Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/) in 2023.

I'm a fan of indexing interesting reads/videos:
[Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:grohan/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLazCpc92HNpzdZsK-4_AKbn5GoAfjbycq)
