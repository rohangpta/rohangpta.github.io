I've been fortunate to dabble in backend development, machine learning,
infrastructure, DevOps, programming languages, and systems through some of the projects below:

- [Penn Clubs](https://pennclubs.com): Penn Clubs is the official student club
  repository at Penn. I work as a developer lead on the product, which is managed as part of the umbrella student development club [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org). Check us out! We build a lot of cool software for the Penn community.
  
- [Spruce](https://github.com/jaredasch/Spruce): A friend and I wrote a parser
  and interpreter in Haskell for a custom language (called _Spruce_) with functional
  features (first class functions, lexically scoped closures) and low-level
  concurrency primitives (fork, wait) alongside a simple interface to support
  [transactions over memory](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm)
  
- [Distributed ML Pipeline](https://github.com/rohangpta/dist-ml-pipeline): For
  a DevOps final project, I built a distributed Machine Learning pipeline on
  Kubernetes that aims to be model-agnostic and supports MLOps practices (Continuous Training and Continuous Monitoring).
  
- [Minimax Group Fairness](https://github.com/rohangpta/523-final-project): For
  an Ethical Algorithm Design class (taught by [Michael
  Kearns](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/)), my group extended a procedure in [Kearns'
  paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03108) on improving group fairness in ML
  prediction problems by minimising the maximum sample error across arbitrarily
  defined groups --
  intending to demonstrate a fairer approach. I ran the implementation and experimentation portion of the project.

- [CIS 1880:
  DevOps](https://cis1880.org/): I co-taught a (now discontinued) class on
  DevOps at Penn.  Born out of an older NETS major's distaste for Penn's
  relatively outdated
  cloud computing class -- NETS 212 -- this class cultivated my budding interest
  in cloud infrastructure. Unikernels anyone?
  
- [RuneScape 2D](https://github.com/rohangpta/runescape-2d): I used to play a lot of RuneScape when I was in high-school, so for a class final project I built a minimal 2D version of the game's old tutorial, mostly for nostalgia.
