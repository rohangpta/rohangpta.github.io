Times of fun, frolic, and of course, learning. For a couple days now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the past 2 years of my life, focusing on the most meaningful aspects. I needed a place to write my reflections down, so I thought perhaps this would make for a fitting first blog post.

I&amp;rsquo;m Rohan Gupta and I&amp;rsquo;m currently a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Networked and Social Systems Engineering, which is pretty much Computer Science with some interesting add-on courses like Algorithmic Game Theory and Scalable &amp;amp; Cloud Computing. In my free time, I like to listen to EDM, play the piano (mediocrely), and go on walks.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in Backend Development, Infrastructure, Machine Learning, and more recently Programming Languages.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://grohan.co/blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grohan.co/blog/</guid><description> Coming Soon™</description></item></channel></rss>
