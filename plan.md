# Next Steps: Leveraged Software Delivery

## Immediate (Week 1-2)

1. **Form LLC**
   - Register in Delaware or home state
   - Simple single-member LLC, pass-through taxation
   - ~$100-500, takes an hour

2. **Set up basics**
   - Business bank account
   - Simple invoicing (Stripe, Mercury, or similar)
   - Basic contract template for project work

## Validate (Month 1-2)

3. **Pick a channel**
   - Upwork/Toptal for fast feedback loop
   - Cold outreach to startups/SMBs in network
   - LinkedIn presence showing agent-driven delivery

4. **Land first paid project**
   - Target: productized scope, fixed price
   - Examples: MVP build, internal tool, data pipeline, integration
   - Price to win, not to maximize—learning > margin early

5. **Deliver with agents**
   - Run agent swarms, document what works/breaks
   - Track: time spent, agent success rate, failure modes
   - Build muscle memory for orchestration

## Extract (Month 3-6)

6. **Notice patterns**
   - What specs recur?
   - What verification checks are universal?
   - Where do agents fail predictably?

7. **Start externalizing the platform**
   - Spec templates → proto-DSL
   - Orchestration scripts → reproducible infra
   - Manual checks → automated verification

8. **Build portfolio + case studies**
   - Document outcomes: "X delivered in Y days"
   - Quantify agent leverage vs. traditional delivery

## Scale (Month 6+)

9. **Raise prices**
   - Platform efficiency = higher margin at same price
   - Or: same margin, undercut market, win more deals

10. **Decide on direction**
    - Stay solo + agents (lifestyle, high margin)
    - Hire GTM to expand client base
    - Hire engineers to harden platform
    - Pursue enterprise wedge (original thesis)

## Open Questions

- Which channel has best signal-to-noise for early clients?
- What project types have highest agent success rate?
- When does the platform become worth productizing vs. staying bespoke?
- At what revenue does it make sense to convert to C-corp and raise?

## The Thesis (Unchanged)

Agents as compilers, not assistants. Outcomes, not hours. Leverage, not labor.

Start small, validate fast, extract the platform from the work.
