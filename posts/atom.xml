This sounds daunting at first - and writing a battle-tested filesystem is hard - but the minimal surface area for a &amp;ldquo;working&amp;rdquo; FS is surprisingly small, simple, and in-distribution for coding agents.
In fact, one of my smoke tests for new coding models is seeing how good of a filesystem they can one-shot! At some point, I had quite a few filesystems lying around - and coding models were getting pretty good - which made me wonder if the models were intelligent enough to actually model the filesystem engine itself?</description></item><item><title>Technical Debt is Entropy In Software</title><link>https://grohan.co/2024/12/27/entropy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grohan.co/2024/12/27/entropy/</guid><description>Entropy # Entropy is the ultimate boss battle [1]. As the reason why ice melts, why tires burst, and why ink diffuses &amp;ndash; thermodynamic entropy is a fact of the physical world, sharply following the arrow of time [2].
The Second Law of Thermodynamics states
For an isolated system, entropy will either increase or remain the same over time; decreases require exporting entropy to the environment.
There&amp;rsquo;s something about inevitability that I think is fascinating, especially when you can see it unfold in front of you &amp;ndash; my favourite visualisation is below (thanks Gemini).</description></item><item><title>Factorials &amp; Fun with Vim</title><link>https://grohan.co/2023/08/10/vim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grohan.co/2023/08/10/vim/</guid><description>I recently hit a somewhat important milestone in my life: one year as a Vim user. Despite its steep learning curve, I used to think that mastering Vim was mostly about habit formation. I swore by the cheatsheets and believed I would be golden. After all, a text editor couldn&amp;rsquo;t be too terribly complex, right?
However, I soon realised how little I knew about Vim and how much there really was to know!</description></item><item><title>Halfway There</title><link>https://grohan.co/2022/06/15/halfway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://grohan.co/2022/06/15/halfway/</guid><description>College. Times of fun, frolic, and of course, learning. For a couple days now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the past 2 years of my life, focusing on the most meaningful aspects. I needed a place to write my reflections down, so I thought perhaps this would make for a fitting first blog post. So here&amp;rsquo;s a couple shoddily jotted down thoughts on what I think have been my most significant takeaways from school, so far.</description></item></channel></rss>
