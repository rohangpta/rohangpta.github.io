# Vision & 60-Day Transition Plan

## Vision: Why I'm Leaving

### The Core Insight

I'm 24 and I've largely been disillusioned by the promise of a corporate job.
I knew this would eventually happen, but I'm surprised at how quickly it
happened. Put simply, I'd like to build:
- A product/platform
- A team
- A culture

I'm driven by passion and first principles problem solving, not cash money.
I felt ~little when I was offered a historic amount of money ($3M) from CitSec
to scale their AI platform.

**What I'm doing here gives me "beta" exposure to this massive shift - AI
transforming software delivery. But I want leveraged beta exposure at minimum.
And I genuinely think with the right approach, I can generate alpha - not just
ride the wave, but shape how this market develops.**

### The Opportunity

I have a few theses I'd like to bet big on. All in, and levered up.

**AI eats the world in a two step process:**
- AI eats software
- Software eats the world

**Code is the universal reasoning layer and deeply bitter-lesson aligned:**
- We are still massively underestimating the market for code. Cursor et al just
  scratch the surface.
- Code is the ecosystem around which you platformize. The skills paradigm is
  exciting for this particular reason.

**General agents are near (mid 2026); workflows are out:**
- "general" = simplicity
- General agents help you take workflows and simplify, vs band-aid process on
  top (a la UIPath, n8n, etc)
- Code AGI is 80% of the economic value of AGI, and we hit it in 20% of the
  time

### The Market

The value to be accrued more broadly is not really "net new software" - it's
converting legacy business process to software.

The mechanics of how this occurs can be derived from first principles:
- Software engineering talent has been the bottleneck to all digital
  transformation
- The bottleneck has created high demand that far outstripped supply, leading
  to a software boom of the 2000s
- Now we have agents that can systematically produce software artifacts on
  average better than the ~average software engineer

**So: what happens when you have "machines that can do the job better than the
average person"?**

### Case Study: The Quants

The quantitative finance industry is a perfect case study - what happens when
machines become better at doing the systematic/mathematical tasks that humans
do.

The key point: the modeling and "autonomy of execution" is applied under risk
limits, with observability. Black box models are in the driver's seat, but we
have a control plane of risk controls, audit-ability, and a fantastic set of
internal tools for automation.

**Assuming we treat "tradeable software work" as a unit (serviced by IT
consulting firms), the future looks a lot like: better pricing, better
execution, better risk controls.**

### The Business Model

There's an implicit risk transfer that happens between businesses and IT
services firms. The ownership of the software is on the IT service firm. They
are on the hook when it goes down. They perform yearly maintenance. This nature
of the business is what allows services firms to sink their teeth deeply into
enterprises, continuously compounding tech debt and therefore demand for their
services.

A leveraged coding agent business will do the same to software delivery: **turn
scoped work into continuously executable, verifiable contracts - contracts will
evolve into verifiable deliverables.**

### Why Not Inside Existing Companies?

Technology companies (where software/AI/tech is a profit center) will invest in
engineering talent (taste) and opt to "build".

The rest will "buy", and the IT services industry is not ready for the demand
- they're already talent bottlenecked and performing deep labor arbitrage,
  poorly managing risk with low incentives to do so.

**The market to "buy" managed, enterprise-ready coding *outcomes* is untapped
yet real.** This is largely the technical "debt" market.

Market efficiency means contracts, verifiable outcomes. These businesses want
outcomes: "regulatory pipeline for X" not engineering talent (or AI engineer
coworkers).

### Why I Can't Build This at CitSec

The alpha I see is in *how* this gets commercialized to enterprises - the
pricing, risk transfer, and go-to-market model. That's fundamentally
a different business than what CitSec does. I can't build that inside a hedge
fund, even with resources. I need full ownership of the product, the customer
relationships, and the risk.

I operate best with total focus, and I need to be all-in on my company.

## 60-Day Transition Plan

**Goal:** Make the platform self-sustaining technically, enable others to
sell/evangelize it, and preserve relationships with leadership.

### Week 1-2: Inventory & The "Spinout" Setup

**The Pitch Prep:**
- **Objective:** Convert `thesis.md` and `vision.md` into a deck for CitSec Leadership.
- **The "Hook":** Identify the specific internal pain point you will offer to "manage" as a Design Partner.

**Technical:**
- Document current state: what works, what's fragile, what's missing
- **The Protocol (Proof of Competence):** Define the "End State" specification for every component.
  - "Here is the rigid spec of what this system *must* do."
  - "Here is the gap between the Spec and reality."
  - *This serves as the Due Diligence material for the investment.*
- Create a risk map: "if X breaks, here's how to fix it"

**People:**
- Identify 2-3 people who will own different pieces:
  - Technical lead
  - Product owner
  - Internal champion/evangelist

**Stakeholder Management:**
- Get leadership alignment on transition plan
- Send communication to CTO + key stakeholders outlining:
  - Last day: [DATE]
  - Transition owners by role
  - **The Handoff Philosophy:** "Leaving you with executable specifications, not just code."
  - *Subtext:* Positioning yourself as a peer/partner, not just an employee leaving.

### Week 3-4: Knowledge Transfer (Technical)

**Documentation:**
- Record video walkthroughs of architecture, key components, debugging
  workflows
- Write runbooks for common issues
- Create "break glass" docs for emergencies
- Set up monitoring/alerting so issues surface early

**Pairing:**
- Pair program with technical successor on critical paths
- Shadow mode: let them drive while you observe
- Have them explain it back to you

**Goal:** By end of week 4, technical lead can handle 80% of issues without you

### Week 5-6: Enable Internal Sales

**Sales Enablement:**
- Create pitch deck/demo for internal evangelism
- Run 3-4 "train the trainer" sessions with potential champions
- Document case studies from successful rollouts
- Record your sales pitch so others can copy it

**Templatize the Motion:**
- Standard deck
- Demo script
- Common objections + responses
- ROI calculator

**Self-Service:**
- Build self-service onboarding flow so teams can adopt without you
- Make it possible for teams to see value in first session

**Pipeline Handoff:**
- Identify 3-5 warm lead teams
- Get them to verbal commits before you leave
- Hand off to successor to close

**Goal:** By end of week 6, 1-2 evangelists can pitch and demo without you

### Week 7-8: Stabilize & Hand Off

**Shadow to Lead:**
- Let successors run meetings/demos while you observe
- Transition your CTO meetings to the new owner(s)
- Fix any critical gaps identified in weeks 5-6

**Final Documentation:**
- Comprehensive final pass on all docs
- Create 30/60/90 day goals for whoever takes over
- Leave contact protocol (when/how to reach you post-exit, if at all)

**Success Validation:**
- Platform processes X workflows without your involvement
- 2-3 people can demo/pitch it
- Y new teams have onboarded (ideally led by someone else)
- Zero critical "only Rohan knows this" gaps

**Final Gesture:**
- Host a "lessons learned" session
- Write a reflection on what worked/what didn't
- Offer to do quarterly check-ins for 6 months (optional)

### Weekly Cadence

**Throughout all 60 days:**
- Weekly update to CTO on transition status, wins, risks
- Bi-weekly all-hands on platform progress (show momentum, celebrate wins,
  introduce successors)
- 1:1s with key stakeholders on how handoff affects them

### What NOT to Do

- Don't start new big initiatives (you won't finish them)
- Don't let people treat you as the permanent owner ("we'll just wait for Rohan
  to fix it")
- Don't promise things beyond your 60 days
- Don't ghost early - stay engaged through the full transition

## Post-Transition: The Next Chapter

### Post-Transition: The "Spinout" Execution

**The Deal (Weeks 1-4 Post-Exit):**
- **Goal:** Close the Seed Investment/Partnership Agreement with CitSec.
- **Mechanism:** Leverage the "Design Partner" contract to waive the non-compete.
- **Immediate Value:** Start building the "CitSec Pilot" (The specific obligation defined in Week 1).

**Goal by March/April:**
- **Signed Design Partner Agreement with CitSec.**
- First iteration of the platform running against the "Clean Room" spec of the CitSec pilot.
- 1-2 *additional* leads (Tier 2 funds) to prove it's not custom-ware.

### Launch (March/April 2025)

Extremely well positioned to start landing contracts.

Focus: **Total focus. All in. Leveraged beta exposure to generate alpha.**
